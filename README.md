# toss_threads
This repo contains files to show the toss of actions between two threads (alternatively) by using mutex and condition variables. 
Toss of actions is like a behaviour:

"Thread 1 says hi"-->>thread 1


"Thread 2 says hello"-->>thread 2


The two threads work alternatively to accomplish the goal.
(The two branches of this repo contain the same code)


# How to use the code?

Step 1: Clone the repo, let's say that you cloned the repo in ~/home/codes

Step 2: Browse to the directory of the cloned repo and type: cd toss_threads, now your path is ~/home/codes/toss_threads 

Step 3: Run the code, type: make, type: ./toss

Enjoy the toss!!!!!!
